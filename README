---VIRUS FIGHTER---

A text adventure game written in Python 3.3

I think it has potential to be a great comedy/cyberpunk story, but I'm not a great writer. So feel free to help! I wanted a story that had similar cheese to the Norton Fighter, but without sticking to the Norton brand.

Summary:

You are an antivirus instance (fighter) with a giant hammer. You spawned in a virtual machine and are on a mission to work through an office building (which is a metaphorical computer system) that has been invaded by viruses. Kill the viruses and collect the security code in order to exit the area.

To do list:

- Better UI: default terminal is UGLY
- Add much more crypto/puzzle elements to the game.
- Combat system
- 'TAKE' and 'USE' commands, which means an inventory and items system.
- Rework the engine, so it's easier to add levels and items.
- Encrypt the player data file to prevent cheating... not that it matters.
- High Score table

That being said, I would like to keep it somewhat simple and traditional and not evolve in to an RPG.
